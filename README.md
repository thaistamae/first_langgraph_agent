# Company Info Agent

A simple LangGraph agent that consults company information using the Yahoo Finance API.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your RapidAPI key:
```
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. You'll need to sign up for a RapidAPI key at https://rapidapi.com to use the Yahoo Finance API.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the agent from the command line:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Web Interface

For a nicer web-based interface, run:
```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a local web server with a Gradio interface. Open the URL displayed in the console (typically http://127.0.0.1:7860) in your web browser.

  - Current price
  - Market cap
  - 52-week price range
